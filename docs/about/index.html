    <h2>About us</h2>

    <p>
            <img src="/MySite/img/team.jpg" alt="team">
    In 1997, Helen Woskob started Designer’s Studio in a small room on Beaver Avenue in State College, PA. Originally envisioned as a boutique showcasing exclusive pieces, it soon became clear that the demand for Designer's Studio's unique furniture and accessories was far greater than could be supported in a one-room shop.</p>
    <p>Today, Designer's Studio has expanded to 15,500 square foot facility in Centre Hall, PA. In addition to the ample inventory in the showroom, customers have access to an in-house design center, where it is possible to work with our Designers to fully customize certain pieces of furniture. </p>
    <p>Despite the larger scale, Designer's Studio still runs on the same principle as it when it was founded nearly twenty years ago. Our showroom features quality items handpicked for their uniqueness and functionality, ranging from accessories and furniture from Italy and India to items made locally in PA from American hardwood. With styles ranging from old world to contemporary, our vast collection is sure to hold the perfect piece to make any home stand apart.</p>
    <p>Visit our showroom today, conveniently located 8 miles east of downtown State College on Route 322. It is easily accessible and has plenty of parking. Click here for directions.</p>

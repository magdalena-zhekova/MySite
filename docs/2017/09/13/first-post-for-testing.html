				<h2>Everything You Need To Know About Traditional Design"</h2>

<p>
You might tend to shy away from traditional design out of fear that it's boring, predictable, stuffy—and it totally can be. But some of its facets are truly interesting, and since it incorporates a lot of antiques, traditional design gives the opportunity to stumble upon some pretty cool pieces. But what exactly makes something "traditional" and just how far back does traditional go? We'll tell you everything you need to know, and maybe you'll be convinced that traditional doesn't always equal staid.
</p>
<h2>
 Traditional Design Is Inspired By The 18th &amp; 19th Centuries.
 </h2>
<p>
As you would have probably surmised, traditional design is inspired by, well, tradition. It's a timeless style taking cues from the 18th and 19th centuries, incorporating classic art, antiques, and pieces with history. Though you'll most often see traditional design influenced by European decor, it can actually incorporate elements from England, France, or even the far east. "Styles and pieces reflect historical design elements using natural materials and colors" says interior designer Erin Gates.
</p>
<h2>
It Strives For Harmony And Order.
</h2>
<p>
True, traditional designs orderly aesthetic can feel boring and staid, but it's predictable for a reason. Consistency is key, as traditional design seeks to create a calm, orderly space, so furnishings will match, symmetry is huge, and everything seems to just go together. Wild and chaotic do not jive with traditional design.
In the traditional design, you'll typically find neutral walls (it is predictable, after all), but color totally has a place. Art, textiles, and decor accents can help pop a room, and dark, rich jewel tones are most commonly used. Think red, brown, green, and plenty of dark wood. "Palettes can be bold and saturated or pale and soft, but tend to be welcoming and not jarring or too graphic," Gates says.
</p>
<h2>
It's All In The Details.
</h2>
<p>
Since order and consistency are essential, character comes in through details. Accessories are grand, like candle holders, vases, and chandeliers, and china, silver, and gold are commonly used. You'll find architectural details like crown molding, columns, and wood-paneling used through traditional design, which add a bit of opulence to a room without looking too ostentatious. Rooms are often centered around a focal point, like a fireplace or oil paintings.
You won't find blinds or bare window coverings in traditional homes. Drapery and valances are classic, usually with heavy curtains. Upholstery, whether for curtains, pillows, or furniture, tend to favor high-end fabrics like silk, velvet, and leather, and bold pattern comes in the form of damask, plaid, or paisley. Many fabrics go one step further with trim. "On drapes, pillows, or upholstered goods—trim adds that little extra detail that shows that something was thoughtfully made" Gates says.
